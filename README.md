Clinic-Finder is a web application and so easy to use.
By entering your postal code, it will show you clinics and hospitals near you. 
I created the backend with Node.JS following REST principles and I used React.JS for the frontend. Also I used Google API and MongoDB in this project.
Also you can add your clinics or hospitals to your favourite list.
There's a login page as well.
