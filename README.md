Final project: 

This is a web app I created as a solo project to help Montrealers find the nearest clinic or hospital family doctor and navigate to healthcare facility. By entering your postal code, it will show you clinics and hospitals near you. Also you can add your clinics or hospitals to your favourite list. The web app was built over the course of two weeks as the final project for my Concordia Bootcamp course.
